# Stock-Simulator
Web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy and sell stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices.

IEX lets you download stock quotes via their API (application programming interface) using URLs

This is just a simulator, not an actual webstie to buy and sell stocks.
